Aequitas
--------

Aequitas is an open-source bias audit toolkit for data scientists, machine learning researchers, and policymakers to audit machine learning models for discrimination and bias, and to make informed and equitable decisions around developing and deploying predictive risk-assessment tools.

Demo
====

`See what Aequitas can do <http://aequitas.dssg.io/>`_.

Sample Jupyter Notebook
=======================

`Explore bias analysis of the COMPAS data <https://github.com/dssg/aequitas/blob/master/docs/source/examples/compas_demo.ipynb>`_ using the Aequitas library.

Documentation
=============

Find documentation `here <https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/>`_.

Installation
============

Aequitas requires Python 3.

Install this Python library from source::

    python setup.py install

...or named as an installation requirement, *e.g.* via ``pip``::

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/dssg/aequitas.git

You may then import the ``aequitas`` module from Python::

    import aequitas

...or execute the auditor from the command line::

    aequitas-report

...or, also from the command line, launch the Web front-end::

    python -m serve

(Note: The above command launches a Web server only intended for development.)

Development
===========

Provision your development environment via the shell script ``develop``::

    ./develop

Common development tasks, such as deploying the webapp, may then be handled via ``manage``::

    manage --help

Containerization
================

To build a Docker container of Aequitas::

    docker build -t aequitas .

...or simply via ``manage``::

    manage container build

The Docker image's container defaults to launching the development Web server, though this can be overridden via the Docker "command" and/or "entrypoint".

To run such a container, supporting the Web server, on-the-fly::

    docker run -p 5000:5000 -e "HOST=0.0.0.0" aequitas

...or, manage a development container via ``manage``::

    manage container [create|start|stop]
