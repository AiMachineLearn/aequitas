    "Recent work in the Machine Learning community has raised concerns about the risk of unintended bias in Algorithmic Decision Making systems, affecting individuals unfairly. While many bias metrics and fairness definitions have been proposed in recent years, the community has not reached a consensus on which definitions and metrics should be used, and there has been very little empirical analyses of real-world problems using the proposed metrics. \n",

    "We present the Aequitas toolkit as an intuitive addition to the machine learning workflow, enabling users to to seamlessly test models for several bias and fairness metrics in relation to multiple population groups. We believe the tool will faciliate informed and equitable decision-making around developing and deploying predictive risk-assessment tools for both machine learnining practitioners and policymakers, allowing researchers and program managers to answer a host of questions related to machine learning models, including:\n",
